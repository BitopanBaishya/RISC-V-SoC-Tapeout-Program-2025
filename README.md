# 🏛️ RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program 2025

Welcome!  
This repository serves as the **master repository** for the documention of my learnings in the 20-week Risc-V SoC Tapeout Program (2025). It contains documentation of the tasks, labs and notes in the form of a weekly repository.

Each week of this program involves:
- 📚 Learning from provided resources  
- 🛠️ Performing labs and hands-on tasks  
- 📝 Documenting progress and challenges  
- 💾 Maintaining a **separate GitHub repository** for that week’s work  

This **master repository** provides a structured and organized way to navigate through all the weekly repositories.  
Visitors can simply expand the dropdown menus below to explore the work done in **Week 0 through Week 20**.
