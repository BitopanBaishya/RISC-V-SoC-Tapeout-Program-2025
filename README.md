# 🏛️ RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program 2025

Welcome!  
This repository serves as the **master documentation hub** for **Phase 1** of my journey in the **RISC-V SoC Reference Tapeout Program 2025**. It contains documentation of the tasks, labs and notes in the form of a weekly repository. In the phase 1, we basically completed the entire physical design flow of the VSDBabySoC using all opensource tools.

Each week of this program involves:
- 📚 Learning from provided resources.
- 🛠️ Performing labs and hands-on tasks.
- 📝 Documenting progress and challenges.
- 💾 Maintaining a **separate GitHub repository** for each week’s work.

This **master repository** provides a structured and organized way to navigate through all the weekly repositories from **Week 0** to **Week 9**.

## 📌 Read Before You Start!
This repository is part of my learning journey in the **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program 2025**. It’s being built step by step as I progress, so think of it as a live learning log rather than a polished final guide.<br>
A few things to keep in mind:
- The repository is organized week by week to reflect the actual flow of the program. This makes it easier to follow along or revisit specific topics.
- Contributions, suggestions, and discussions are always welcome. Even small corrections can help make this resource better for everyone.
- If you find this useful, please share it with your peers.
